# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
  ### Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to help Bobby show his manager how many employees are reaching retirement and of those employees how many are from each department. This will help Bobby's manager understand how many positions will need to be filled in the near future so that the company doesnt fall short in staffing and production. The second request that Bobby's manager had asked was to find which employees are eligible canidates to be considered for the new mentorship program that the company want to introduce. The requirement to be considered for this program is that the employees had to be born in the year of 1965. Why that year specific, no one knows but Bobby's manager so we just complete what is asked.
  ### Results
  - Of the 300,024 Employees, 90,398 will be retiring from the company. That makes up 30% of the company! This could present a huge impact if the company doest not start looking for new hires to fill those shoes as it will very likely impact the company as a whole, both in Revenue gaines and employee moral.

  - In the table above, you can see that Senior Engineers and Senior staff hold the highest retirement count. This helps Bobby and his manager understand which positions will need to be filled in the near coming. As these positions have a hirer experience level, promoting within would be a great start as filling the shoes of the lower tiered positions may be easier to fill.
  - The other research that was requested of us was to see which employees meet the requirements to start the Mentorship Program. Based on the mentorship_eligibility.csv file, we see that there are 1549 employees that meet the one specific requirement...being born in 1965. 
  - Based on mentorship data, there doesnt seem to be enough employees to help mentor new or existing hires to fill the upcoming roles. We have to adjust the age requirement to help suport the need. If we change the birth year range from soly 1965 to 1964-1965 then that would give us over 19,000 employees to help provide mentorship.
  ### Summary
Bases on the analysis and what we have uncovered, we understand that there will be potentially 90,398 positions to fill as those individuals are now at retirement age. Of those retires, only 1549 meet the standart to help mentor any new hires or promotions within. 
I do not belive that there will be enough people to mentor new, imcoming employees to fullfil these roles in time. I suggest adjusting the mentorship requirement back one year, making the birth year being between 1964 and 1965. This will give us 19,905 employees instead of 1549 to become mentors. Although this isnt a 1:1 ratio, this will gives us a 5:1 ratio, 1 mentor per 5 new hires.
